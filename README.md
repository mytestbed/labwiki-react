This is the beginning of a new React based UI for LabWiki.

Right now the backend is a node.js server with `webpack` to simplify
development.

Get started
-----------

    npm install
    npm start
    
We are also using `eslint` and the AirBnB style guide. In order to use that, install 
`eslint` as command.
 
    npm install -g eslint
